# Like Every Video

Like Every Video is a browser extension that defaults to liking every YouTube video watched
to support content creators.
This extension is made for people that are too lazy or too forgetful to like every video they watch. This does not prevent you from disliking or unliking, the default will just be a like.

<div style="text-align:center"><img src="assets/social.png"/></div>
